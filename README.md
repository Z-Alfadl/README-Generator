# README-Generator
## Description
This is an application that queries a user with questions and uses that input to generate a professional README file that covers the essential details of their project. The purpose of this is to guide the user in creating the requisite README and reduce the amount of time creating it, freeing up their time to dedicate more energy towards the acutal project.

## Installation
Project files can be downloaded through GitHub. To run the file, open a terminal window in the project directory. The user should then run the command "npm i" to install the dependencies..

## Usage
The application can be run in the terminal by entering "node index.js", after which the user will then be presented with a series of questions that, when answered, will generate a useable markdown file titled with the project name they entered as a response to the first question.
